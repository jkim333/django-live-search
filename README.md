## Running this project

To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately.

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. In a terminal (windows terminal), run the following command in the base directory of this project

```
python -m venv env
```

That will create a new folder `env` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on windows:

```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the project dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the project with this command

```
python manage.py runserver
```
